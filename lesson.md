# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using the `ml` environment for this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces the end-to-end supervised learning workflow- preprocessing variables, evaluating supervised learning models and the bias-variance tradeoff.

## Part 1 - Supervised Learning Workflow

We will be using the `notebooks/part_1_supervised_learning_2_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate ml`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/part_1_supervised_learning_2_lesson.ipynb`, follow by `notebooks/part_2_supervised_learning_2_lesson.ipynb`, `notebooks/part_3_supervised_learning_2_lesson.ipynb` and `notebooks/part_4_supervised_learning_2_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
